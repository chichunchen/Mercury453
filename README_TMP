Hey guys - lets use this as an informal code communication for outstanding 
issues.

DELETING FILES FROM REPO
It appears that there is no way to remove a file from a repository. The delete
command as specified in hg only appears to require that the file be unstaged
from the next commit. Perhaps we don't need to care. As a kludge we could 
modify the add command to allow it to be called when a given filename no longer
exists, indicating in needs to be removed in next commit.
