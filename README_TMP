Hey guys - lets use this as an informal code communication for outstanding 
issues.

DELETING FILES FROM REPO
It appears that there is no way to remove a file from a repository. The delete
command as specified in hg only appears to require that the file be unstaged
from the next commit. Perhaps we don't need to care. As a kludge we could 
modify the add command to allow it to be called when a given filename no longer
exists, indicating in needs to be removed in next commit.

#-------------------------------------------------------------  
FILESYSTEM

all data will be stored in directory .repository. Repository will have
subdirectories .stage, .files, as well as a text file for each manifest. Here
is an example directory/file stucture

.repository/

  .stage/
     fileA.txt
     fileB.txt
     fileC.c

  .files/
     fileA.txt.1
     fileA.txt.2
     fileA.txt.3
     fileA.txt.4

     fileB.txt.1
     fileB.txt.2

     fileD.txt.1
     
     fileE.txt.1

  manifest1.txt
  manifest2.txt
  manifest3.txt
  manifest4.txt
  manifest5.txt
#-------------------------------------------------------------  

The manifest file will list all file-revisions that are in a given commit.

A couple example manifest files are:

  manifest1.txt:
    fileA.txt.1
    fileB.txt.1
    
  manifest2.txt:
    fileA.txt.2
    fileC.txt.1
    
  manifest3.txt:
    fileB.txt.2
    fileC.txt.2
    fileD.txt.1
